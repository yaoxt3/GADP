**Pick-and-place manipulation cross grippers without retraining** is a diffusion-based policy for transferring pick-and-place knowledge across different grippers. This knowledge transition does not require retraining or fine-turning the policy with the new gripperâ€™s configuration. Instead, it only needs to introduce the configuration in the policy inference phase and make the generated trajectories satisfy safety constraints, ensuring the successful completion of pick-and-place tasks.

# Algorithms
We provide the implementation of the following algorithms: 
- Simple DP3 MM Proj Flag: `simple_dp3_mm_proj_flag.yaml`
- Simple DP3 MM: `simple_dp3_mm.yaml`
- Simple DP3 Proj Flag: `simple_dp3.yaml`
- Simple DP3: `simple_dp3.yaml`
- Simple DP: `simple_dp.yaml`
- Simple DP Proj: `simple_dp_proj.yaml`

*Simple DP* and *Simple DP3* are the baseline policies. *Simple DP Proj*, *Simple DP3 Proj Flag*, and *Simple DP Proj* are baseline policies with **Safety-Constrained Trajectory Projection**.

*Simple DP3 MM Proj Flag* is our full policy with **Safety-Constrained Trajectory Projection** and **Gripper Mapping**. Both of these 2 policies use robot pose, point cloud, and image from the perspective of the gripper as observations. Our base policy is Simple DP3 MM, and training is on this policy.

# Installation
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions for **Pick-and-place manipulation cross grippers without retraining**. For certainty map generation, you need to create another conda environment. The installation is following [HybridGen](https://github.com/wangzivector/HybridGen.git):
```bash
cd certainty_map_generator 
conda create --name map_gen python==3.10.4
conda activate map_gen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Real Robot

**Hardware Setup**
1. Franka Robot
2. Franka Gripper
3. Robotiq2F
4. **D455** Realsense Camera 
5. Mounted connection base (connect Franka with Robotiq2F) and Mounted 3D-printed fingertips with different length and width [[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ii9fPaFdQ9Ytj5jkcw6WOnCQ67B3PmhC/view?usp=sharing)]
6. A PC with Nvidia GPU and PyTorch Framework (For data collection, policy training, and online inference)
7. A workstation with real-time kernel (for real-time control and supervision)

**Software Setup**
1. Ubuntu 20.04.01
2. [Franka Interface Control](https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/index.html) 
3. [Franky](https://github.com/pantor/frankx) (High-Level Motion Library for the Franka Emika Robot)
4. [Robotiq2F](https://github.com/ros-industrial-attic/robotiq.git)
5. [Azure Kinect ROS Driver](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure_Kinect_ROS_Driver.git)
6. [ROS Joystick Drivers](https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers.git)
7. [easy_handeye](https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye.git)

**Data Collection**
Run [easy_handeye](https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/easy_handeye.git) to compute the extrinsic matrix for later calibration. It computes an extrinsic matrix between the camera frame and the robot base. This step is run on your workstation with the real-time kernel.

Then, on the PC with Nvidia GPU for data collection, use the following command to collect data into a certain folder:
```bash
cd ./action_infer/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun action_infer record_robot_data.py
```
Before this step, install Azure Kinect ROS Driver on your PC with Nvidia GPU. In another terminal, run Azure Kinect ROS Driver **(Caution: Azure Kinect ROS Driver may have bugs on Ubuntu versions after 18.04)**:
```bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch azure_kinect_ros_driver driver.launch
```
On your workstation with real-time kernel, use the following command to send the robot's pose and action to the data collection PC:
```bash
cd ./action_executor/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch teng_arduino joy_controller_no_pc.launch
```
Every collected real robot demonstration (episode length: T) is a dictionary:

1. "point_cloud": Array of shape (T, Np, 3), Np is the number of point clouds, 3 denotes [x, y, z].
2. "rs_img": Array of shape (T, H, W, 3)
3. "azure_img": Array of shape (T, H, W, 3)
4. "azure_depth": Array of shape (T, H, W)
5. "agent_pos": Array of shape (T, Nd), Nd is the action dim of the robot agent, i.e. 7 for the pick-and-place task (6d position of end effector + 1d gripper opened width)
6. "action": Array of shape (T, Nd + 1). We use *relative end-effector position control* for the robot arm and *one-hot encoding (close or open)* for the dex hand.
7. "certainty_map": Graping probability map generated by GG-CNN (T, H, W). Use a script [here](certainty_map_generator/generate_certainty_map.py) to generate grasping probability maps. Following [HybridGen](https://github.com/wangzivector/HybridGen.git) and [GG-CNN](https://github.com/dougsm/ggcnn.git).

For training and real-robot experiments, you should preprocess the point clouds (Hand-on-base calibration, cropping using a bounding box, Grasping Probability Map Star generating and FPS downsampling). Use the following script to package the pickle file as a zarr file.

**Training the policy**
To train the policy. For example:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/train_policy.sh dp3_mm pick-place-kinect-rs-dot 0219 0 0
  ```

**Real-robot experiment**
To run the real-robot experiment, you need to run several nodes. First run Azure Kinect ROS Driver:
```bash
cd ./action_infer/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch azure_kinect_ros_driver driver.launch
```
In another terminal, send certainty maps to the inference module on the PC with Nvidia GPU:
```bash
cd certainty_map_generator 
conda activate map_gen
python3 send_certainty_map_dot.py
```
For the inference module, on the PC with Nvidia GPU, we have four "action_infer" scripts for different policies:
- Simple DP3 MM Proj Flag with Grasping Probability Map Star: `action_infer_mm_queue.py`
- Simple DP3 MM Proj Flag with RGB Image on gripper: `action_infer_mm_queue_rgb.py`
- Simple DP as baseline: `action_infer_dp_queue.py`
- Simple DP3 as baseline: `action_infer_dp3_queue.py`

To run "action_infer", use this command for example:
```bash
cd ./action_infer/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun action_infer action_infer_mm_queue.py
```
For the action execution module, on the workstation with real-time kernel, run action execution. For the Franka Panda robot arm mounted with Franka gripper, run this command:
```bash
cd ./action_executor/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch teng_arduino action_execution_with_no_pc.launch
```
For the Franka Panda root arm mounted with Robotiq2F, run this command:
```bash
cd ./action_executor/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch teng_arduino action_execution_with_no_pc_robotiq2f.launch
```
## Videos, training data, and model weights are being organized.
